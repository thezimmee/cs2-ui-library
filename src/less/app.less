/**
 * app.less
 * --------
 * main controller for css/less files.
 *
 * GUIDELINES:
 *  - style categories:
 *      - vendor / 3rd party
 *      - abstracts
 *      - base
 *      - components
 *      - views
 *  - class identifiers: each "component" or "view" gets a unique, base class ("single source of truth"). class naming conventions are as follows:
 *      - .[namespace-][block][__element][--modifier]
 *      - namespace: version or namespace to differentiate our classes from others.
 *      - block: unique, base identifying class.
 *      - element: child element of the base parent.
 *      - modifier: state or variation of the base parent.
 *  - file organization:
 *      - vendor files are managed by package manager and placed in a separate vendor/ directory.
 *      - base and abstract styles are inside of main less/ directory.
 *      - styles for components and views should be placed with other files related to that view or component (e.g., views/home/home.less).
 *  - it's okay to "mix" classes. a "mix" is when multiple components, or views and components, are applied to an element.
 *  - utility classes:
 *      - apply utility classes as mixins are "extends" whenever possible.
 *      - never apply a utility class on an element that already has a class (update the styles for that class instead).
 *      - do not apply more than 2 utility classes to any given element. when more than 2 utility classes are needed, create a view or component class instead.
