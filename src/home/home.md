# CS2 UI Library

The goals of the UI Library are to:

- unify the CS2 UI.
- speed up development time.
- make the CS2 UI stunningly beautiful and a joy for the end-user to work in.

by doing the following:

- standardize the UI codebase.
- give developers code patterns to seamlessly plug in.
- document standards and guidelines for working in the CS2 UI codebase.

## Release History

    - footer

## Upcoming

- Add base modules, such as forms, menus, modals, buttons.

- Generators (?) to build common features, such as pages, components, etc.
- Better align `developer-standards` with [CSS at Scale](https://docs.google.com/a/virtuosobranding.com/presentation/d/1HFf8cDV6W4iIvL3PjPrOKO0On8NwIReO0lNnpfTiJ-I/edit) presentation.
