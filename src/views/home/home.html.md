# CS2 UI Library

The goals of the UI Library are to:

- unify the CS2 UI;
- speed up development time;
- make the CS2 UI beautiful and delightful (e.g., **speed**) for the end-user to work in;
- document reusable style blocks for public / client consumption;

by doing the following:

- standardize the UI codebase;
- modularize each style block to be able to "plug in" anywhere;
- document standards and guidelines for working in the codebase;
